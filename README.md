# March Madness 2023 Predictions
This python script goes through my work for Kaggle's 2023 March Machine Learning Mania Challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/march-machine-learning-mania-2023). The goal was to give a probability that Team A beats Team B for every possible combination of teams. The project sought to do this for both the men's and women's tournaments. The .xlsx file shows the predicted probabilites derived from a shallow neural network.
